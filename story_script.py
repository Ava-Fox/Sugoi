intro = '''
    You're practicing your instrument in music school when a hot guy catches you play. He's impressed and asks you what your name is.
    ''' 

invite_to_practice = f'''
    'Well, I like your stuff. What do you think about coming over to my band's next practice to jam?'
    ''' 

realization = '''
    You realize who you're talking to. Reality shifts and everything comes into focus as you find yourself conversing with the one and only Griffen R., the hottest, most talented, most popular guitarist in the school's most beloved band. 
    '''

band_practice = '''
    \nIf you were a pirate you would certaintly be shivering your timbers, because as you walk through the front door and enter the foyee of Griffin R's... let's say, house? you are greeted by a cluster of very beautiful people. You feel the weight of your instrument case overcome your fragile, musical hands and hear the horrendous sound of your own dignity crash to the floor as you drop your case. THUD - that's it; you're a goner. Nobody will probably ever talk to you again. However, just as you begin to devise your escape, a pair of finely manicured hands flash into your vision, accompanied by your aforementioned Judas of a case. Looking up, you see who they belong to.\n\n'Hi', he says, 'you dropped your... uh, sorry...  what do you play again?

andy_description = '''
    He smiles, stealing your breath away, because he's left you no choice but to look at his magnificent face. Delicate, faded freckles speckle his face, shadowed by brilliant blades of bright red hair. Proportions nothing short of perfect; this dude certaintly is symetrical. 
'''

house_description = '''
 "House" is a little too back-alley of a word to describe the place you find yourself in. Lathered in deep red carpetry, a tone that complements Andy's hair, and milky white walls with deep green velvety furniture, you're scared even breathing will soil the place's solemnity. At least, your breathing will. It isn't just Andy and Griffin who's been blessed with the attractive-gene in this room. There are still two more demi-gods your neurons are struggling to process.
