intro = '''
    You're practicing your instrument in music school when a hot guy catches you play. He's impressed and asks you what your name is.
    ''' 

invite_to_practice = f'''
    'Well, I like your stuff. What do you think about coming over to my band's next practice to jam?'
    ''' 

realization = '''
    You realize who you're talking to. Reality shifts and everything comes into focus as you find yourself conversing with the one and only Griffen R., the hottest, most talented, most popular guitarist in the school's most beloved band. 
    '''

band_practice = '''
    \nIf you were a pirate you would certaintly be shivering your timbers, because as you walk through the front door and enter the foyee of Griffin R's... let's say, house? you are greeted by a cluster of very beautiful people. You feel the weight of your instrument case overcome your fragile, musical hands and hear the horrendous sound of your own dignity crash to the floor as you drop your case. THUD - that's it; you're a goner. Nobody will probably ever talk to you again. However, just as you begin to devise your escape, a pair of finely manicured hands flash into your vision, accompanied by your aforementioned Judas of a case. Looking up, you see who they belong to.\n\n'Hi', he says, 'you dropped your... uh, sorry...  what do you play again?

andy_description = '''
    He smiles, stealing your breath away, because he's left you no choice but to look at his magnificent face. Delicate, faded freckles speckle his face, shadowed by brilliant blades of bright red hair. Proportions nothing short of perfect; this dude certaintly is symetrical. 
'''

house_description = '''
 "House" is a little too back-alley of a word to describe the place you find yourself in. Lathered in deep red carpetry, a tone that complements Andy's hair, and milky white walls with deep green velvety furniture, you're scared even breathing will soil the place's solemnity. At least, your breathing will. It isn't just Andy and Griffin who's been blessed with the attractive-gene in this room. There are still two more demi-gods your neurons are struggling to process.

gabby_and_avery = '''
Lounging on one of the Brunswick armchairs sits Gabrielle LastNameHere, lazily cleaning her glasses. She looks up and gives you a half-nod. A curly blonde lock of her hair falls to slightly obstruct her vision; she blows it away nonchalantly and refocuses on her spectacles. 

The window behind her is half obscured by a finely chiseled form, surveying the view. It may just be the nature of being backlit, but you could swear you could see the outline of every muscle through his shirt. As he turns towards the commotion, you understand why his figure was so exquisitely defined in defiance of the fabric - because he actually wasn’t wearing one at all. 

You think maybe it’s time you said something. 

'''

nipples = '''
    ‘NIPPLES?!’ OH NO!!! You can feel tears beginning to form behind your eyes because your stupid freudian slip of the tongue can’t even get words straight enough to get through one interaction with the Famous Five without committing a major faux-paus! That’s it, you unwittingly committed social suicide and are officially done for, maybe if you shoot yourself now you can get out of this interaction with some semblance of dignity left.
“Oh, thanks! I work out.”  
Huh? Maybe you really will get out of this jam session alive.
